**Choi Ung (Choi Woo-Sik)** and **Kook Yeon-Su (Kim Da-Mi)** broke up 5 years ago. A ==documentary== they filmed during their high school days becomes popular. *They donâ€™t want to, but they have to stand in front of the camera.*

Choi Ung seems *naive and a free spirited man*, but he wants to have something for the the first time in his life. For that, he shows what he holds in his mind. Kook Yeon-Su aimed to become the top student at her school, but she is now *an adult who lives fiercely, adapting to her reality.*
